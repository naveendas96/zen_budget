## Purpose

This file gives concise, targeted guidance for AI coding agents working on the Zen Budget Flutter app. It documents the project's architecture, developer workflows, platform-specific notes, and concrete examples of common edits.

## Quick facts

- Tech: Flutter (multi-platform: Android, iOS, web, macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Entry point: `lib/main.dart` (single-app widget tree)
- Linting: `analysis_options.yaml` includes `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
- Tests: widget tests live under `test/` (example: `test/widget_test.dart`)

## Common commands (run from repo root `zen_budget/`)

- Install deps: `flutter pub get`
- Static analysis: `flutter analyze` (honors `analysis_options.yaml`)
- Run tests: `flutter test` or `flutter test test/widget_test.dart`
- Run app (device): `flutter run -d <device>` (hot reload with save)
- Build Android APK: `flutter build apk`
- Build iOS (on macOS): `flutter build ios` and open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode for signing

Platform notes

- Android: Gradle Kotlin DSL is used in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`. The Android config references `local.properties` for SDK paths. Use `./gradlew` in `android/` for native Gradle tasks if needed.
- iOS: `ios/Runner/Info.plist` is present; open the Xcode workspace when modifying signing/capabilities.
- Windows/macOS/Linux: native runners are under `windows/`, `macos/`, and `linux/` — builds require platform toolchains (Visual Studio on Windows, Xcode on macOS).

Project conventions and patterns (observe and follow)

- Single entrypoint app: `lib/main.dart` defines `MyApp` and `MyHomePage`. New screens/widgets should be added under `lib/` and exported via subfolders.
- Dependency edits: update `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`; prefer caret constraints as used in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Lints: follow `analysis_options.yaml` rules. If you need to relax a lint for a single file, use `// ignore_for_file:` comments rather than changing global lints unless a clear project-wide reason exists.
- Tests: widget tests emulate UI (see `test/widget_test.dart`). When changing UI text or icons, update tests accordingly.

Integration points and generated files

- Generated plugin registrant files live under platform folders (e.g., `ios/Flutter/`, `windows/flutter/`); avoid editing generated files directly.
- No `build_runner` codegen observed in `pubspec.yaml`; assume manual edits for model/serialization unless new generator packages are added.

Examples (concrete edits)

- Add a new dependency: add to `pubspec.yaml`, run `flutter pub get`, update imports in `lib/`.
- Fix lint warnings: run `flutter analyze`, then modify the code or add precise `// ignore:` comments for unavoidable cases.
- Reproduce test failure locally: `flutter test test/widget_test.dart` and iterate until green.

What not to change unless instructed

- Platform-generated files (the `ephemeral/` folders, files under `ios/Flutter` generated by Flutter).
- The plugin registration or Gradle boilerplate unless addressing a platform build issue.

Where to look first for context

- `lib/main.dart` — app structure and stateful widget examples
- `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies and Flutter setup
- `analysis_options.yaml` — lint and analyzer configuration
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` & `ios/Runner/Info.plist` — platform config examples
- `test/widget_test.dart` — example test to follow for UI changes

If you need clarification

- Ask the maintainer for desired device targets, signing keys, or CI specifics. I can propose CI steps (GitHub Actions) if you'd like this repo to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on PRs.

If anything here is incomplete or you want a different focus (CI, release signing, or modularization), tell me which area and I will iterate.
